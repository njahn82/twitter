# R helper functions for parsing Twitter Search API

Mining Twitter for data analysis often requires further data manipulation if loaded via [twitteR](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/). This collection of functions search current tweets by a given hashtag and parse data such as co-occurent hashtags, expanded URLs or user mentions directly out of the corresponding JSON-entities.
